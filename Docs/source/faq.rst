Can I use PyPLUTO with Python 3.9?
----------------------------------

No, PyPLUTO is compatible only from Python 3.10 onwards.
Although we do not expect to always update PyPLUTO to only the latest version
possible, we will try to keep it up to date with the latest versions of Python
to take advance to the most up-to-date features.
