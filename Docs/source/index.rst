Welcome to PyPLUTO's documentation!
===================================


**PyPLUTO** is a Python library which loads and plots the data obtain from the 
PLUTO code simulations.
The aim of this package is to simplify some non-trivial python routines in order
to quickly recover plots that can be inserted in scientific publications.
Check out the :doc:`install` section for further information regarding the 
installation, the section :ref:`install <loadclass>`.
