Test 12 - LP Riemann 2D test
============================

The Disk-Planet test offers a nice view of an interaction of a planet embedded
in an proto-stellar disk rotating around the protostar.

The display shows the density profile of the disk and presents two different
zooms of the planet region in density scale and angular velocity scale.
